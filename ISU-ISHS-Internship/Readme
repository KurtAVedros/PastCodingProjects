This project i was incharge of updating and making any neccessary changes to a preexisting MS SQL Database and website in order 
to Upload Deep Zoom Images of historical artifacts.

I will include my code that I worked on and the mini visual studios project i created to speed up the process of uploading 
images. Any code I did not write I will state as predone code.

Due to legal reasons, I will not show any images used for this project or the names of the images. However you should beable to
tell how the image was uploaded and used.
