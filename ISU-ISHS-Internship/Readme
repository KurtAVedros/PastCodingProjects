This project i was incharge of updating and making any neccessary changes to a preexisting MS SQL Database and website in order 
to Upload Deep Zoom Images of historical artifacts.

I will include my code that I worked on and the mini visual studios project i created to speed up the process of uploading 
images. Any code I did not write I will state as predone code.

Due to legal reasons, I will not show any images used for this project or the names of the images. However you should beable to
tell how the image was uploaded and used.

For Database I had to make minor changes such as removing Materials and Second Materials as well as relocating the information
on the separate ReDiscov database. Changes to the procedures was done as necessary to diplay the correct information.

For Uploading information to the database, I created and used the SQLINFOUploader program I created as well as a free application
called Image Composite Editor to splice the image for Deep Zoom and gimp2 for creating thumbnail images. Note the images had to be
of high quality. Usually around 9000x12000 size.

For website edits I mainly had to make changes to text, icon, layout, navigation and image display. Since this was mainly making
small edits to predone code. I will not show the code, without consent from Idaho State Historical society.

Example of required edits below.
    Change century description to this "".
    There should be a navigation tool bar across the top such as
       Home / century / artifactCommonName
    Change icon and color scheme to accomidate for the new ISHS style.
    Change all the font to necessary font type.
    Change sample image carousel located at the homepage to display these images.
    Create footer links to our home site and legal information.
