This was my senior project for Bachelors degree in Computer Science.

The goal was to create a program that could successfully show and maintain a piping system though simulation. This included having the
ability to build the system and test it with readings such as flow rate.

I was in charge with creating and maitaining a Database through MS SQL and connecting the Database to the project 
with a Database Access Layer as well as creating documentation.

Helped create classes for each Database Table as well.
