Contains all code created for the project.

Worked on Class Tables code with Nathan Thompson. Labled any code that I did as such.

Did all of the SQLCode file. While it is not normal to constantly delete and reconstruct the Database.
I wrote the SQL to be able to construct it by simply running the code provided since the project Database was relatively small in size
and not alot of preset data was needed. 
(Note will have to remove the DELETE codes if running for the first time.)
